# Complex test scenarios
---
## Requirements
- Executable with Maven
- Runs on developer machine
- Runs on both Windows and Linux
- Uses Junit 4 (test reports, well understood by developers)
- Need test classification
    - `lengthy` for weekly tests
    - `single`, those that affect all of EC, like Object Partitioning
    - `ui`, for selenium tests

---
## Analysis of Manual test
- Benefit = Complexity Ã— Execution_Time
---
## Missing Pieces
- Multi-host cluster with SSL
- Kerberos/SSO Environment
- Network traffic shaping
- OPC server that can be automated
- Environments of old versions
- Download of files from browser (log files, reports etc.)
- Integration tests for non-selenium tests
    - conventions for parameters
    - infrastructure (where in the Jenkins pipeline, how to provision)
